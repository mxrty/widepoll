# Widepoll

Live at: www.widepoll.com

A web framework for representing granular user opinions on user-submitted content.

##### Domains:

- Areas of the site designated for discussions on a given topic. For example the d/science domain is for discussing all things science.

##### Sentiments:

- Sentiments is a feature that allows users to mark content submitted by other users as either agree, disagree or bias. This can be done for subsets of content, allowing for a granular expression of opinion compared to likes and dislikes.
